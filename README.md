# ADVENT OF CODE 2021

These are my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) written in Typescript. I will try to post each solution the same day that it comes out, but I don't promise anything!

**NOTE:** _I have been using [Deno](https://deno.land) to run my Typescript files. If you want to compile it with `tsc`, you should delete the `.ts` extension of the import statement in every file._
