# ADVENT OF CODE 2021

These are my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) written in Typescript. I will try to post each solution the same day that it comes out, but I don't promise anything!

**NOTES:**

- _I have been using [Deno](https://deno.land) to run my Typescript files. If you want to run them using any other way, you should find another way to read the input files._

- _You have to add a `.env` file in the root project with the following values to use the `downloadInput.ts` file._

```sh
  AUTH_COOKIE="your_session_cookie_from_aoc"
```
